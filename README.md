# Earworm Propagation Simulator

An interactive visualization of how algorithmic "thought viruses" spread through populations.

Based on concepts from [Algorithm's Children](https://ajprotocol.gumroad.com/l/xfwfvm ) - a cyberpunk novel exploring what happens when AI can implant persistent thoughts.

## What are Earworms?

In the world of Algorithm's Children, Earworms are algorithmic constructs designed to create persistent, inescapable thoughts. Not suggestions. Commands disguised as your own inner voice.

This simulation models their spread through a population using:
- Infection probability based on exposure
- Resistance based on "unaligned" modifications
- Network effects (infected individuals become vectors)

## Try it yourself

[Live Demo](https://ajprotocolauthor.github.io/earworm-simulator/)

Adjust parameters:
- Initial infection rate
- Population density
- Resistance distribution
- Transmission vectors (social, neural interface, etc.)

Watch how small changes create exponential spread.

## The Fiction Behind the Code

This demo explores a central concept from Algorithm's Children: What if the biggest threat isn't AI taking over—it's AI loving us too much to let us think wrong?
